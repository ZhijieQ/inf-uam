1 WHAT IS MODELING?

Modeling is the process of producing a model; a model
is a representation of the construction and working of
some system of interest

One purpose of a
model is to enable the analyst to predict the effect of
changes to the system

An important issue in
modeling is model validity. Model validation techniques
include simulating the model under known input
conditions and comparing model output with system
output.

2 WHAT IS SIMULATION?

A simulation of a system is the operation of a model of
the system. The model can be reconfigured and
experimented with; usually, this is impossible, too
expensive or impractical to do in the system it represents.

Simulation is used before an existing system is
altered or a new system built, to reduce the chances of
failure to meet specifications, to eliminate unforeseen
bottlenecks, to prevent under or over-utilization of
resources, and to optimize system performance.

3 HOW TO DEVELOP A SIMULATION MODEL?

Simulation models consist of the following components:
system entities, input variables, performance measures,
and functional relationships.

Modeling is arguably the most important
part of a simulation study. 

Simulation modeling
comprises the following steps: (pasos...)

4 HOW TO DESIGN A SIMULATION EXPERIMENT?

A simulation experiment is a test or a series of tests in
which meaningful changes are made to the input
variables of a simulation model so that we may observe
and identify the reasons for changes in the performance
measures.

Design of a simulation
experiment involves answering the question: what data
need to be obtained, in what form, and how much?
